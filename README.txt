This is basically automating commands and steps laid out by Troy @ TROYPOINT and has been tested ONLY on the ONN Android TV Box and my TCL Android TV. That doesn't mean it will work for you. 

You should already have Developer Options available and these settings enabled.
USB Debugging - Force Allow Apps on external - Force activities to be resizable
If not, you'll need to google how to do so. There are too many devices to include instructions here.
